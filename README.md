# Functional-Disorder-Hotspots
Custom based prediction of intrinsic disorder in human kinome and analysis on functional disorder hotspots
We present an LSTM-based deep learning framework for high-confidence prediction of intrinsic disorder regions (IDRs) across the human kinome. Following the prediction phase, we developed a hotspot scoring system that integrates key biophysical features to highlight regions of functional relevance.

To explore family-specific disorder trends, we computed a kinase family-based scoring system, enabling the identification of disorder "trendsetters" within specific kinase families.

To further understand the structural integrity of these disordered regions, we implemented a probability model grounded in molecular properties, offering insights into their potential regulatory and interaction roles.
